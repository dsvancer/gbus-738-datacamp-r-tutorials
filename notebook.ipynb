{"cells":[{"source":"# Welcome to GBUS 738\n\nData mining—the art of extracting useful information from large amounts of data—is of growing importance in today’s world.\n\nThe amount of data flowing from, to, and through enterprises is enormous, and growing rapidly—more rapidly than the capabilities of organizations to use it. Enterprises are trying to make effective use of the abundance of data to which they have access: to make better predictions, better decisions, and better strategies. Therefore, managers now need to know about the possibilities and limitations of data mining.\n\nThis course introduces data mining problems and tools to enhance managerial decision making. Students will learn how to ask the right questions and how to draw inferences from data by using the appropriate data mining tools. This course will enable students to approach business problems data-analytically, envision data mining opportunities in organizations, and follow up on ideas or opportunities that present themselves.\n\n<br>\n\nStudents will gain skills in the following areas:\n\n  - **Programming for analytics** using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/)\n  - **Data Analysis** with the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) suite of R packages\n  - **Machine Learning** with the [Tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) package - a unified framework for developing machine learning algorithms in R \n\n<br>","metadata":{},"id":"c46485ed-ef9a-40ba-bc88-e5111e572e3f","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Course Material\n\nThis workspace contains executable `R` notebooks for the course programming tutorials. \n\nThey can be found in the **_r_tutorial_notebooks_** folder.\n\nLectures notes and videos can be found on the [course website](https://gmubusinessanalytics.netlify.app/)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c7e394b7-f3f1-4924-8af8-b640dde80c32"},{"source":"<h1 id=\"Professor\"> Professor </h1>\n\n<table cellSpacing = 20>\n    <tr>\n      <td><img width = 80% \n           src=\"./files/david_s.png\" alt=\"David's Profile Picture\"></td>\n      <td>\n        <p style = \"font-size:30px\">David Svancer</p>\n        <em><p style = \"font-size:17px\">Adjunct Professor of Business Analytics</p></em>\n        <p style = \"font-size:17px\"><strong>George Mason University</strong></p>\n        <a href=\"https://business.gmu.edu/profiles/dsvancer\"\n               target=\"_blank\">\n              School of Information Systems and Operations Management </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<br>\n<br>","metadata":{},"id":"1ceed07a-40fa-4df2-8f2a-a803d6ba7f90","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"R","codemirror_mode":"r","pygments_lexer":"r","mimetype":"text/x-r-source","file_extension":".r","version":"4.2.1"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"R","language":"R","name":"ir"},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
